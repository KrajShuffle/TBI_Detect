# TBI_Detect

This is a group project comprising of Karthik Raj, Justin Yeung, Akash Canjels, and William Livingston with mentorship from Dr. Ester Kwon and Julia Kudryashev. This project aims to develop an objective approach for detecting Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) while addressing current time-intensive and lack of flexibility issues with commmon TBI detection methods. I worked on the circuit design, setting up both Raspberry Pi & infrared camera, and designing a simple framework for capturing images of fluorophore emissions from either the 490 nm or 770 nm flurophores. 

## Abstract
Heightened enzymatic activity of proteases Calpain-1 (CAPN1) and Matrix Metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) are characteristic biomarkers of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Activity of these proteases has been shown to increase with severity of TBI, and is thus a suitable target for in-vitro diagnosis. We seek to develop an inexpensive, rapid, point-of-care diagnostic device using a lateral flow assay (LFA) and a portable imaging device. Working with the Kwon lab, we have developed an in-vitro fluorescent diagnostic system for injectable peptide probes specific to CAPN1 and MMP9. Our LFA can detect cleaved residues within a range of 20-100 nM using the LI-COR Odyssey Platform, and our imaging device is able to capture fluorescent signals at ~490 nm and ~770 nm. There are multiple future directions of this project, including optimization of the LFA sample pad, characterization of the LFA-imaging device, automating image capture to signal readout, and multiplexing the LFA and imaging device.
